      <h3 class="XZ3" align = "center">Sony XZ3</h3>

      <p>The XZ3 is great for gaming with its 6.0 – inch full HDR OLED borderless display. The colour, contrast and clarity are outstanding thanks to the HDR OLED display. The display is combined with a QHD+ resolution (1440 x 2880 pixels), and if that wasn’t enough, Sony has re-introduced a dynamic vibration system which enables the user to feel the game whilst you’re playing! The user will experience the environment as if they were present in the scene. The dynamic vibration system doesn’t just work for gaming, it also works for movies and music. This phenomenal technology enhances the intensity of each dramatic moment for the player to experience the game for all it has to offer. <br>
      </p>
      <p> This is the loudest phone Sony has created, 20% higher volume with the S-Force front surround sound. Crystal clear quality coming directly to your ears. The world’s first 4k HDR movie recording in a smartphone will completely change viewers’ experience along with a 5.7inch borderless display.

	  <p>As always, the cameras on Sony phones are on another level! The XZ3 has a 19MP high resolution camera, which enables you to take quick snappy pictures despite tricky lighting conditions. The camera also has an AI motion eye technology, ensuring you never again miss a shot since the phone is faster than you yourself! The front camera has a 13MP lens, allowing you to take those all-important stunning selfies.
		</p>
	 <p> According to Sony, the design is “elegant, durable and intuitive”. I myself find it hard to disagree as the design and curvature do look incredible. It comes in a range of beautiful colours (black, white silver, forest green and Bordeaux red). As in all standard Sony phones, the XZ3 is waterproof (IP65/68) and, of course, has a fingerprint scanner. However, there is a brand new feature that’s been introduced to the XZ3. Side sensors allows users to double tab and pull up quick access to all their favourite apps. This is similar to Samsung, so it’s about time Sony uses this feature.  </p>
	 <p>Finally, the battery life on this phone will last all day despite heavy usage. Inside the XZ3 there is a 3330mAh battery with intelligent optimisation. Smart stamina works one step ahead and keeps you powered up for longer. Sony has stated that the AI predicts your power levels, warns you early and makes your battery last.  Isn’t this what we all need? </p>
