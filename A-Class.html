	  <p> Devouring, this stream-lined beauty will take your breath away as it is perfectly balanced in comfort, efficiency, and convenience. Inside the A-Class Saloon, you will get the luxury side of cutting-edge innovation. The upgraded Mercedes Benz User Experience (MBUX) interface utilises the advancements of artificial intelligence to build a personalised connection between the driver and the vehicle. This is made possible not only by recording the driver’s preferences for driver assistance yet also via intelligent voice control with natural speech recognition. The driver ought to merely say a statement to which the MBUX responds, e.g. ‘Hey mercedes, navigate to home’.
