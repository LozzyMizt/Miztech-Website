      <p>“Do what can’t be done.” – Samsung <br>
      </p>
      <p>And alast! Note 9 has been revealed.   
		</p>
		<p>“Galaxy Note has always put powerful technology in the hands of those who demand more. Now, the all new Galaxy Note9 surpasses even these high expectations, focusing on what matters most in today’s always-on, mobile world.” – Samsung </p>

	  <p> As is the advantage of android phones, let’s talk about the battery life. The Note9 has a whopping 4000mAh battery which means it is enough for a day for the today’s average user. That is, for the heavy users - which let the truth be told is the majority of us - it is a dream come true. As if that was not enough, you get more storage with the Note9! You have the option to choose between the 128GB model or the 512GB (built in) model, both arriving with expandable storage of up to 512GB. You can also enjoy the scenes thanks to the all-new quad HD+ super AMOLED screen, Samsung’s largest infinity display – with a resolution size of 2960 x 1440, that’s 516 pixels per inch!
		</p>
	 <p> You know the unique perspective that Samsung manages to conquer? Not leaving any single individual out. This is for the gamers. The Note9 is optimised for gaming meaning high performance games can be played with minimal lag owing to the model’s new cutting-edge processor. Concerns of overheating? Not an issue as the Note9 is built with a water-carbon cooling system preventing that very issue in the first place. Wait, there’s more! AI-based performance has been added to ensure your game stays smooth throughout the course of playing.  </p>
	 <p>The S Pen evolves around Bluetooth technology, essentially allowing the device to operate as a remote. You have the comfort of changing slides, photos, or pausing music/YouTube videos with merely a touch of a button! You can even change the controls in accordance to your convenience allowing a personalisation of the device. Now get this – according to Samsung in just 40 seconds the device can be charged with power worth of 30 minutes. </p>
