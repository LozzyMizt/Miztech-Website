      <p>The new roadster from Tesla can go 60mph in a whopping 1.9 seconds with a top speed of over 250mph. If that wasn’t enough… according to Tesla it can travel up to 620 miles in one charge. The roadster is focused on performance, the unique design helps it to achieve aerodynamic efficiency and it really does push it to a whole new level. <br>
      </p>
      <p> The vehicle itself is all wheel drive and like any other Tesla models this roadster is fully electric. It’s safe to assume the roadster is lighter than any of Tesla’s previous models. It is powered by a 200kWh battery pack which enables the car to have better drag. In terms of performance this roadster doesn’t mess around as it performs better than a Bugatti Veyron (Multi-million pound hypercar).

	  <p> This roadster is the second generation of its kind and it’s equipped with all-wheel drive as standard. This means that all four wheels will get power at the same time when driven. Unlike most coupes this roadster has 4 seats. No specific measurements were provided for the rear seats but we can assume that it will be tight. 
      Prices start around $200,000 which is in level with some supercars. Considering the specs you get with the roadster, it’s worth it. Sales will begin in 2020. Therefore, you better start saving up!
